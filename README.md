# Expense Tracker

An expense tracker built using React. Users can add expenses (title, amount, date) as well as filter expenses based on different years. This project was my first ever React project and covered the topics of components (stateful, stateless, controlled and uncontrolled), state, event handling, lifting state up (from child to parent components) and two way binding.
